# camera_tracking

run the command: **roslaunch camera_tracking sim.launch** to start the simulation. This will launch Gazebo, Rviz and a basic node that counts the amount of points given by the camera from a PointCloud2 message.

In gazebo you can add a kinect_camera and more items in the environement to test it.
