# camera_tracking

run the command: **roslaunch scrum_project sim.launch** to start the simulation. This will launch gazebo,rviz and a basic node that counts the amount of points given by the camera from a PointCLoud2 message.

In gazebo you can add a kinect_camera and more items in the environement to test it.
